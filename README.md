# High_Performance_Programming

High Performance Programming course repository.

The course project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, using parallelized and non-parallelized approaches. 

  - Project 1 - KNN serial implementation
  - Project 2 - KNN parallelized with OpenMP
  - Project 3 - KNN parallelizad with MPI

The objective is not to achieve the best performance with the KNN algorithm (and indeed, they don't!), but to practice some parallelization concepts.
